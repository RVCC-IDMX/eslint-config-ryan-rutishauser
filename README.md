# ESLint Config
## Let's Learn an ESLint Rule

This refers to an error that occurs when the computer tries to add semicolons where they are absent
but fails to recognize they do not belong there. This error can also occur when the computer omits semicolons from where the human
included them and they do belong. This is important because it can point the human's attention to such problems and allow him to correct them.
